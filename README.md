<p><b>Basic Background Information:</b> 
I’m 22 years old and Buddhist, my family immigrated to Australia from the Philippines when I was 8 years old. I speak both Tagalog and English at home. After high school, I enrolled for a Bachelor of Social Sciences but I did not complete the degree due to life circumstances but I am ready now to go back to school and learn again. I’m a gamer and the games I currently play are League of Legends and Teamfight Tactics both by Riot Games although recently I’ve been spending less time gaming and more time studying. My hobbies other than gaming are exercising, yoga, reading and book club with my online friends.</p>

<h2><u>Interest in IT</u></h2>
<p>My interest in IT stems from being exposed to technology all my life from gaming as a little kid learning English through playing Pokémon and Final Fantasy, to witnessing the transformative power of IT in real time with social media cementing itself as an integral part of modern society and streaming services replacing Entertainment TV for the newer generations. My interest to go ahead and study IT sparked from watching a Game Dev streamer talk about and play the game they worked on so passionately and thinking to myself that I would like to do that one day. I have no real IT experience but I am very eager to learn more as the experience has been enjoyable thus far. I chose to study at RMIT because it is online and I love the flexibility that online learning gives me and the Bachelor of Information Technology degree entry requirements via OUA allows me to dip my toes in the water before fully committing to it. The IT umbrella is very diverse and I expect to learn a lot about anything that falls under the IT umbrella and hopefully decide and start an IT career path at the end of this journey.</p>

<p>My ideal job would be a video game programmer; this job appeals to me because I would love to work on a game one day and maybe make my own somewhere down the line and this job would allow me the privilege of working on multiple games and learning the skills required to make games.</p>

<p>The skills required for this job are proficiency in coding and coding languages such as C, C++ or C#, knowledgeable in a game discipline, be a team member with great verbal, written and interpersonal skills, excellent time management, able to familiarise quickly with codebases and other technical skills, love for games and the game industry 
The qualifications required are a 
‘Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science or equivalent experience, 
2 years’ professional software development experience, 
and experience interfacing with 3D art applications’ (Keywords Studios 2022).</p>

<p>The only requirements I meet currently are a love for games and the game industry and the ability to be a good team member with decent verbal, written and interpersonal skills which I’ve acquired through years of playing a game where teamwork and communication whether verbal or written is essential to a good game experience. </p>

<p>To acquire the required skills and qualifications for the job I plan on finishing this unit and enrolling for the Bachelor of Information Technology degree then finishing the degree and hopefully getting a job in software development to get the experience necessary. I would also be taking game design related classes when possible to gain the knowledge needed to be able to work on games.</p>

<h2><u>Personality Profile</u></h2>
<p><b>MBTI:</b></p>
<p style ="color:ForestGreen;"> INFP-T </p> 
<p><b>Learning Style:</b></p>
<p>Visual/Tactile</p> 
<p><b>Big Five:</b></p>
<p style = "color:Yellow;"> Openness – 94% </p>
<p style = "color:Purple;"> Conscientiousness – 15% </p>
<p style = "color:Red;"> Extraversion – 10% </p>
<p style = "color:Green;"> Agreeableness – 90% </p>
<p style = "color:Blue;"> Neuroticism – 54% </p>
<p>My learning style results tell me that I learn best when it’s through a visual medium or through hands-on experience moreover, I know that when I’m learning something that is both of a visual and tactile nature I can understand and replicate it easily. My personality test results reinforce to me that I am a kind-hearted and open, highly empathetic understanding individual that wants the best for everyone and is constantly on a path of self-introspection and improvement but with all that comes a severely introverted and shy nature compounded by my own social anxiety.</p>
<p>I believe I would make a good group member because I offer a unique view on matters that considers everyone else’s wants and needs before my own and find solutions that are for the good of the team even if it’s at the cost of my own wants and needs. My introverted nature may have a negative effect on my behaviour in the group since it makes me naturally averse to group work but to counter that I’ve been practicing and warming up to group work via participating during lectures and tutorials.</p>
<p>When forming a team, I should consider people with more extroverted personalities to make me feel at ease with talking more so I can contribute as best as I can and other sympathetic/empathetic personalities to understand that my quiet and passiveness is not disinterest but deep thought and introspection.</p> 

<h2><u>Project Idea</u></h2>
<p><b><u>Overview</u></b></p>
<p>Along with gaming I am also passionate about social justice and social media so my project idea is a social media app for gamers that doesn’t remain impartial in matters regarding social justice and the like while educating its users to be more socially conscious and aware to create safe spaces for queer gamers, gamers of colour, and women in gaming and hopefully create a positive online community for gamers in general.</p> 

<p><b><u>Motivation</u></b></p>
<p>My motivation for this project is my own experience growing up immersed in the gaming world as part of a marginalised group, I have witnessed the severe toxicity of gamers firsthand along with the normalised homophobic, racist and misogynistic attitudes and behaviours that come along with it. I know many others like me feel that they don’t have a safe space in the gaming world on the internet so I want to fix that by creating an app that is proudly pro social justice to create an environment where gamers from marginalised groups can feel safe knowing that the platform truly has their back when so many others just wear the social justice flavour of the month as a costume.</p>
  
<p><b><u>Description</u></b></p>
<p>My app would have the basic social media essentials such as a profile, posts, reposts, follow/follower/following, private messages, likes, news feed, etc.   
The features of my social media app that would make it an app for gamers would be profile customisation based on games they play, a profile search list that shows other people that play the same game/s to help the user find their community, a ‘hall of fame’ area on their profile where they can post videos or screenshots of their favourite plays or show off stats or display collections etc. The profile customisation would be able to go deeper than just games and could go into favourite roles or characters, rank whichever is applicable if the user chooses to. The result of this user customisation would be the heart of the app as it would allow tailored posts matching the user’s choices e.g. if a user chooses ‘League of Legends’ as their game and ‘Support’ as their role, the app would show on their home; posts of their followed profiles and high traffic posts from profiles they don’t follow that have also chosen ‘League of Legends’ or ‘League of Legends Support’ and the more specific the customisation the more frequent posts regarding the deeper customisation would show on the timeline as opposed to just the base game. This would also allow the user to sooner find and grow their community within the app as it shows people with similar interests. The profile search list would default to the customisation but users can change filter parameters if they wish to diversify their timeline.
The app would give users tips on practicing mindfulness and positivity to encourage healthier interactions between users. To educate users on social consciousness and make it a safe space for marginalised gamers, on account creation, users would be required to read resources on unlearning biases on account creation then informed that anything they do that breaches the T&C regarding hate speech and bigotry would result in a warning which informs them how they’ve violated the T&Cs and gives them resources to self-educate on why what they’ve done is a violation in order to do better next time, a further violation would result in a suspension which would then give further resources to self-educate and if the user is serious about changing and getting their account back they would have to write an apology and acknowledge their wrongdoings. The profile of the app would also be used to spotlight women in gaming, queer content creators, content creators of colour and to spread general resources to strengthen the users’ social consciousness. Account reports would be processed and judged on a case by case basis instead of automatic flagging as a human touch is needed to understand the nuances of what is and isn’t hate speech/bigotry.</p>
<p><b><u>Tools and Technologies</u></b></p>
<p>My app would require a social media website to be built from scratch to have it achieve the desired effect and to do that a computer or laptop is needed to code; the web app would also need to be translated into a mobile phone app so an iPhone and Android would be needed to test the mobile phone app builds. A cloud database to store relevant information and a server to host the website would also be needed.</p>
<p><b><u>Skills Required</u></b></p>
<p>The skills required to create my app are frontend development, backend development, UX and UI design, and general IT knowledge.</p>
<p><b><u>Outcome</u></b></p>
<p>If the project is successful I hope the app can teach gamers open mindedness and empathy so that gamers can have a space online where positivity is the norm and where queer gamers and gamers of colour, and women in gaming can exist without getting random hateful comments. I hope the app can be used for fun, positive interactions, making meaningful connections and growing communities.</p>
