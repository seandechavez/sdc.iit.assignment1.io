<p><b>Basic Background Information:</b> 
<body> I’m 22 years old and Buddhist, my family immigrated to Australia from the Philippines when I was 8 years old. I speak both Tagalog and English at home. After high school, I enrolled for a Bachelor of Social Sciences but I did not complete the degree due to life circumstances but I am ready now to go back to school and learn again. I’m a gamer and the games I currently play are League of Legends and Teamfight Tactics both by Riot Games although recently I’ve been spending less time gaming and more time studying. My hobbies other than gaming are exercising, yoga, reading and book club with my online friends.</body>
